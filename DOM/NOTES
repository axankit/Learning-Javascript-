DOM MANIPULATON

1. Window object and Global object
2. Node
3. HTML collection is not an array. but they have some common thing. As a result we can use some property of array.
HTML collection and Node list is different.


.innerText ,innerHTML AND textcontent

innertext :- text which is only visible on screen

textcontent :- text also appears which may be hidden by any css property.

innerHTML :- text with HTML like 
[ here to learn about DOM Manipulation <span style="display: none;">Ankit its your choice</span>' ]

queryselector is the most using. To use queryselector better you need to have good understanding of CSSselector 

We can do query further if we stored in variable

I would prefer to see code directly but basically 

we learn about 
by using parent element how we can access child Element and vice versa 

After one line break Browser not count further line break as new nodes.
