1. ðŸ“¦ Why we need IIFE ?

B. to avoid variable pollution of Global scope


Chat GPT 
When you have code that you only need to run once and don't want to keep the variables around after.
- It's like a mini playground inside your code where you can play, but the toys don't stay around forever.

ðŸš€ **Benefits**:
 Avoids polluting the global namespace (the playground).
 Keeps your code organized and prevents conflicts between different parts of your program.


2. ðŸ§¹What is IIFE
IIFE is a way that help to execute code instantly

Chat GPT 
It's like inviting a friend to play with their toys, but only for a short while. It helps you run code without creating a bunch of global variables that stick around and clutter your playground (or program).


3. Syntax of IIFE in different case 
Named IIFE AND Simple IIFE

4. point to be noted when you write two IIFE in same file

Chat GPT
in most cases, when you write two functions one after the other without semicolons, JavaScript's Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI) will usually insert the necessary semicolons to separate the statements. This is why it typically works without semicolons in regular function declarations.

However, the situation is slightly different with Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE). An IIFE is a function expression that's immediately executed. Since IIFE is considered a single expression, the JavaScript parser might not handle the automatic semicolon insertion as expected.
