# Observation 

1. Javascript is language which execute line by line(sequential).
   But has some execption

one of them is events

code of events execute only when certain activity happens.

## Different approach for Events

2. we can also put events in HTML( Inline ) which is not feasible at all specially when we build in scale.

onclick="alert('herr0')"

3. document.getElementById('owl').onclick = function(){
alert("owl clicked")
}

4. attachEvent()
5. jQuery - on
